General:
========

- add "aliases" (allow for scriptlets) - leverage [DR] helper method rework?
- create web [service] interface (use sinatra?)
  - simple interface (3 actions)
    - connect (returns token and maps it to an IP)
    - gets
    - puts
- refactor "hijack.rb" so that it can be testable (add tests)

Dragonrealms:
=============

- ensure that underlined text terminates at the end of the line (ex: healing)
- incorporate the use of a skinning knife in "skin_and_loot_script.rb"
- move helper-methods (currently in "base_dragonrealms_script.rb") into a mixin
