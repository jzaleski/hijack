General:
========

- clean up "execute" method in "lib/hijack/manager/script_manager.rb"
- add "aliases" (allow for scriptlets) - leverage [DR] helper method rework?

Dragonrealms:
=============

- ensure that underlined text terminates at the end of the line (ex: healing)
- incorporate the use of a skinning knife in "skin_and_loot_script.rb"
- move helper-methods (currently in "base_dragonrealms_script.rb") into a mixin
