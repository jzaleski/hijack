General:
========

- figure out the best way to fully integrate the pause/resume functionality. How
  should scripts detect and handle the state-change?
- clean up "execute" method in "lib/hijack/util/script_manager.rb"

Dragonrealms:
=============

- create "juggle" script
- ensure that underlined text terminates at the end of the line (ex: healing)
- incorporate the use of a skinning knife in "skin_and_loot_script.rb"
- create "remove_my" and "wear_my" helpers in "base_dragonrealms_script.rb"
