General:
========

- add "aliases" (allow for scriptlets) - leverage [DR] helper method rework?
- add the ability to highlight patterns
- make silencing RT messages when one or more scripts is running the default,
  but keep it configurable.
- add the ability to re-{calculate,configure} screen cols/rows
- need to trim the HTML content in "output" once it is past a certain length
- add command history to web-interface (up/down arrow to scroll through history
  is sufficient for now)

Dragonrealms:
=============

- incorporate the use of a skinning knife in "skin_and_loot_script.rb"
- move helper-methods (currently in "base_dragonrealms_script.rb") into a helper
