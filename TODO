General:
========

- bridge is not fully disconnecting when EXITing from a script
- add "JRuby" compatibility to "LichNetHelper" (see: "base_gemstone_bridge.rb")
- figure out an intelligent means to print the result of a config-proxy
  operation to the output-pane

Simutronics:
============

- figure out the best way to share methods between DR/GS (mixins?)

Dragonrealms:
=============

- incorporate the use of a skinning knife in "skin_and_loot_script.rb"
- create alchemy (mortar & pestle) script

Gemstone:
=========

- figure out how to more closely emulate "go2" functionality with the current
  travel-script architecture (thought: go to the nexus, if not at the nexus
  then navigate out to other location)
- enable "LichNet" for the "WebInterface"
